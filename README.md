# 👋 Hey, I’m Anton — Student Dev of Crypt

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate young developer from South East Queensland, currently building tools to help students communicate securely and simply — starting with **[Crypt](https://github.com/Anton-tumurov)**.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 High school student at Rochedale SHS
- 💻 I build secure communication apps (Python, Tkinter, Inno Setup)
- 🚀 Currently working on: **Crypt**, a privacy-first messaging tool
- 🤝 Also Mentoring and Educating Others in my Field
- 📚 Learning more about APIs, UI/UX design, and collaborative coding
- 😊 And just a chill guy!

 I was born in Moscow, Russia, in a Mongolian-Belarus family surrounded by technology from age 4. We moved to Australia in 2014 when I was 2. I started my programming journey experimenting with Arcade machines, then I got my first microprocessor -- A micro:bit, which I used to create many different programs, which I published here at github.com -- all at age 7.

By age 9, I was building convoluted redstone machines in Minecraft, and by age 10, I learned line-based programming languages like Python and C++, which at age 12 I put to use in a school STEM project, building an affordable solar tracker for efficient Solar power; Our team won the WoS regional conference in 2024. My father is a lead IT Engineer at Shell Australia, and he is the one who first got me into Computers.
