# 👋 Hey, I’m Anton — Student Dev of Crypt

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate young developer from South East Queensland, currently building tools to help students communicate securely and simply — starting with **[Crypt](https://anton-tumurov.github.io/Cryptexe/)**.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 High school student
- 💻 I build secure communication apps (Python, Tkinter, Inno Setup)
- 🚀 Currently working on: **Crypt**, a privacy-first messaging tool
- 🤝 Also Mentoring and Educating Others in my Field, like [CRAZY-DAVE09](https://github.com/CRAZY-DAVE09)
- 📚 Learning more about
  - UI/UX design,
  - Cryptography, and
  - Networking
- 😊 And just a chill guy!

 I was born in family surrounded by technology from age 4. I started my programming journey experimenting with Arcade machines, then I got my first microprocessor--A micro:bit--, which I used to create many different programs, which I published here at github.com. All at age 7.

By age 9, I was building convoluted redstone machines in Minecraft, and by age 10, I learned line-based programming languages like Python and C++, which at age 12 I put to use in a school STEM project, building an affordable solar tracker for efficient Solar power; Our team won the WoS regional conference in 2024. My father is a lead IT Engineer at an international company, and he is the one who first got me into Computers.

## 🧭 Goals

- ✅ Build secure student tools (done)
- ✅ Teach someone else to code (in progress)
- 🔜 Spread Crypt so that eventually everyone will know about it
- 🌍 Then turn it into the greatest communication app (I'm joking)

### 🤷‍♂️ Unrealistic Goals
Idk something 

Thanks for stopping by. Stay Cryptic. Stay Curious.
